## Data Models

Within the LAB-TOUR-SH project, different data models were developed, which are listed in the following table. The data models are adapted to the needs identified in this project and meet the compatibility requirements of the different systems used in the LAB-TOUR-SH project. This mainly concerns the FIWARE platform, which is the basis for contextual information.

|Data Model|Description|
|---|---|
|[Occupancy](https://github.com/cam-fg/lab-tour-sh-doc/tree/main/models/Occupancy)|An atomic occupancy value. Can be used to describe the occupancy of a single point in time. This occupancy could be taken from a sensor or predicted by a model.|
